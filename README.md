# METRO DW Prototype using Mesh Join and Star Schema

## Introduction

This document outlines the design, implementation, and analysis of a Data Warehouse (DW) prototype for the METRO shopping store in Pakistan. The DW prototype is designed to improve the analysis of sales data, customer information, and inventory levels. The prototype utilizes the Mesh Join and Star Schema data modeling techniques.

## Design

The Star Schema data model was chosen for the DW prototype as it provides a simple and intuitive data structure that is easy to understand and can be easily queried using standard business intelligence (BI) tools. The schema consists of fact tables and dimension tables. Fact tables contain the measures (e.g. sales, quantity, etc.) and dimension tables provide the context for the measures (e.g. time, location, etc.).

The Mesh Join technique is used to combine data from multiple sources into the DW. This allows for a more complete and accurate picture of the data and eliminates the need for manual data reconciliation. The Mesh Join is implemented using the Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process to integrate data from different sources into the DW.

## Implementation

The DW prototype is implemented using a combination of SQL and Java. The SQL is used to create the schema and the tables, and to query the data. Java is used to perform the ETL process and to perform data analysis.

The following tools and technologies were used for the implementation:
- SQL Server: for database management
- Java: for data analysis and ETL
- Hibernate: for database management and SQL execution

## Analysis

The DW prototype was analyzed to evaluate its effectiveness and efficiency in providing insights into the sales, customer, and inventory data. The following metrics were used to evaluate the prototype:
- Query performance: the time it takes to retrieve data from the DW
- Data accuracy: the degree to which the data in the DW is correct and complete
- Data consistency: the degree to which the data in the DW is consistent across different sources

The results of the analysis showed that the DW prototype provides fast and accurate data retrieval, with a high degree of data consistency. The prototype can be easily queried using standard BI tools and the Star Schema structure makes it easy to understand the data relationships.

## Conclusion

The DW prototype designed, implemented, and analyzed for the METRO shopping store in Pakistan demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of the Mesh Join and Star Schema data modeling techniques for improving the analysis of sales, customer, and inventory data. The prototype provides fast and accurate data retrieval and can be easily queried using standard BI tools. The results of the analysis show that the prototype can provide valuable insights into the sales, customer, and inventory data.
